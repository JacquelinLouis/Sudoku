# Introduction
This Sudoku project is designed to be a facade of my current knowledges.
It won't show only my development's skills but also how I consider a project must be implemented from the first to the last brick.

During this development I will try to follow those steps:
1. Specifications
   1. Define user's flow and UIs
   2. List error cases and how to deal with it.
2. Architecture
   1. Split the application in layers using a version of the Clean Architecture (View, ViewModel, UseCase, Repository)
   2. Document technical limitations when encountered and solutions chosen
   3. Define implementations' dependencies and time
3. Development
   1. Start the development following the plan
   2. Adjust the plan from encountered issues
4. Improvement
   1. Restart the steps from the first's step with new features
